## Humane or Not

We'll use Conventional Neural Networks to classify that whether the given image is `Humane or not`.For this particular task high-level-api that is keras is used .

## Dependencies

- keras

- opencv

- matploitlib

- numpy

## Usecases

### Keras

Is a high-level-api , we'll use [very-deep-convolutional-networks-for-large-scale-image-recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) to train and classify the images.

### Opencv

Used to import the images , resizing the images to make every images of equal size , changing the color system.

### Matplotlib

Can be used to for later visualisation of the images for verification purpose.

### Numpy

Is used to computation , performing Linear-Algebra based operations on the image array.

## Dataset

Download this dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images) and extract into `input/data` folder if you want to work on the problem on your machine.

### Running the App

I want to present this project on [kaggle](kaggle.com) , you can run the app [here](https://www.kaggle.com/guru001/humans-or-not/).
