## About this Repo

This Repo consists of Machine Learning based projects that are build on opensource frameworks like `scikit-learn, keras , tensorflow`.
## [from_stratch](https://github.com/guruprasaad123/ml_for_life/tree/master/from_scratch)
Folder `from_stratch` consists of ML projects that are build from scratch .

1. [Neural Networks from scratch](https://github.com/guruprasaad123/ml_for_life/tree/master/from_scratch/NN) , 

   This project was build with the intent of gaining more insighst about neural networks , Stochastic-gradient-descent , Logistic regresssion

2. [Kmeans ](https://github.com/guruprasaad123/ml_for_life/tree/master/from_scratch/k-means),

   Mimicks the scikit-learn's kmeans clustering algorithm from scratch using just numpy.
## [supervised](https://github.com/guruprasaad123/ml_for_life/tree/master/supervised)
Folder `supervised` consists of Real-time-applications / Projects based on Machine Learning.
