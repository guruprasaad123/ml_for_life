# Gradient Descend

This project is all about learning how gradient works.So the best way to learn something is to implement it from scratch so in this project we'll implement `batch-gradient-descent`algorithm.

## Requirements
numpy == 1.16.2    
matplotlib == 2.2.2

you can also install these requirements using `requirements.txt`.
