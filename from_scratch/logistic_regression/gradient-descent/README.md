# Logistic Regression

In this repo i have performed*Logistic regression* using *gradient-descent* which is optimization method on a sample dataset that we generated on our own.

## Dependencies

- numpy

- pandas

- matplotlib

We use numpy for mathematical computation , pandas for framing the sample dataset that we generated . matplotlib to visualize the loss which reduces over training.

## Under the hood

 *loss function* for logistic regression is different from linear regression
